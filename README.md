# ml-from-scratch
Ground-up implementations of neural network components, from autodiff to transformers.
Currently included:
- A minimal automatic differentiation engine (in the style of micrograd)

All of the present code was written earlier during self-study. The repository structure and code were organized and uploaded in a short time window.

This repository is intended to be extended gradually, following a bottom-up approach from basic autodiff to more complete neural network models.
