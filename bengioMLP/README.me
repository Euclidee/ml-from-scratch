# Bengio-style MLP Language Model (From Scratch)

A minimal implementation of a Bengio-style MLP language model, built as part of a
from-scratch learning path following early neural language modeling ideas.

This project focuses on understanding the core mechanism of mapping discrete tokens
into a continuous embedding space and using a simple feedforward network to model
local letter dependencies.
